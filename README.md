How Truss Works üõ†Ô∏è

üöÄ Overview
Truss is a dynamic module generation tool that helps developers quickly create components, blueprints, and design systems for web applications. Built with a modern tech stack and integrated with OpenAI's API, Truss automates the generation of structured modules, reusable components, and project instructions.

Whether you need to generate specific modules like Authentication, Dashboards, or UI components, or a project blueprint to understand your app‚Äôs structure, Truss handles it all efficiently and cleanly.

üéØ Core Features
Module Generation

Generate logic, structure, and optional UI designs for individual application modules.
Supported Tech Stacks:
React, Node.js, Tailwind CSS, or custom frameworks.
Output includes:
Component logic in JavaScript/JSX.
Styling in CSS, SCSS, or Tailwind CSS.
Blueprint Generation

Build a blueprint (application plan) that outlines all required components and their relationships.
Ideal for understanding the structure and scope of your application before coding.
File Packaging and Downloads

Truss packages all generated files into a ZIP archive for easy download and integration into your project.
Detailed Build Instructions

Generate step-by-step instructions on:
How to set up the project environment.
Organize files and folders.
Link and use generated modules effectively.
‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
1Ô∏è‚É£ User Input
You start by describing your module or application requirements:

Module Name: E.g., "Authentication System" or "Dashboard UI".
Tech Stack: React, Node.js, Tailwind CSS, etc.
Functionality: Brief description of what the module does.
Mobile Support: Yes (Responsive Design) or No.
Module Focus: Logic/Structure or UI Design.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Blueprint Creation (Optional)
If you select "Generate Blueprint", Truss uses OpenAI's API to:
Analyze your application description.
Break it down into modular components (e.g., Login Page, Dashboard, API Service).
Provide an overview of what components need to be built.
Output: A visual blueprint of your application‚Äôs structure.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Module Generation
If you select "Generate Module", Truss generates:

Component Logic:
Code for functionality (e.g., forms, event handling, API calls).
Clean and structured files in React, JavaScript, or custom frameworks.
Component Design:
Styles using Tailwind CSS, SCSS, or raw CSS.
Optional design files can be customized as per the tech stack.
4Ô∏è‚É£ File Download
All generated files (code and styles) are packaged into a ZIP archive.
You can download and directly integrate them into your project.
5Ô∏è‚É£ Build Instructions
Truss also generates detailed step-by-step instructions for:
Setting up the environment.
Installing dependencies.
Organizing folders and linking components.
Running the project.
üíª Tech Stack
Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS
Backend: Node.js with Express
AI Integration: OpenAI GPT-4 API
File Management: JSZip for bundling files
Styling: Tailwind CSS, SCSS, and responsive design principles
